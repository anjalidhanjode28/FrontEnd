useReducer
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

This Hook accepts 2 arguments: a reducer function and an initial state.

useReducer(reducer, initialState);
It returns an array of two values which can be destructured to the current value of the state and a dispatch function.

Let's learn about its arguments and returned values:

state: This is the current value of the initialState passed to the Hook.
reducer: The reducer is a function that accepts the state and an action. Based on these arguments it determines how the value of state will change.
dispatch: The dispatch function is how we pass an action to the reducer function. It dispatches the action to be used to update the state.
Action is an object with type and payload as it properties.
Hereâ€™s the counter example :

const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
Specifying the initial state

There are two different ways to initialize useReducer state. You may choose either one depending on the use case. The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument:

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    {count: initialCount}  );
