// Description
// Harry and John want to do a competition of weightlifting in which they can lift as many weights as they want. There are N weights numbered from 1 to N where ith weight has a value weight[i]. We have to find the total weight lifted by both of them separately after the competition ends.
// Competition ends when all the weights have been lifted by them. The rules of the game are as follows-
// Harry will lift the weight from left to right and John will lift the weight from right to left.
// Harry will start the game and in the first move he can only lift one weight i.e. weight[0].
// After the first move, the players will play alternatively i.e. after the first move the John will lift, then again Harry boy and so onâ€¦..
// The boy will lift the least possible weight just greater than the weight lifted by the other boy in the previous move i.e. if one boy lifts weight equal to 8 in the previous turn, then the other boy has to lift a weight greater than 8 (using one or more weights).

// 1
// 11
// 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5
